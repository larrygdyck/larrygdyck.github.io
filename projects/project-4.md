  <p>I designed the enclosure in five separate, stackable segments, each one having an hexagonal footprint. This provided optimum cooling for each GPU and allowed individual segments to be removed for maintenance or repair as necessary while allowing the other segments to continue operating, reducing down time.</p>

  <p>I constructed this computing tower using off the shelf components, including 25 AMD Radeon RX580 Graphics processing units (GPU's) which handle the task of processing the mathematical algorithms that verify blockchain transactions and generate new cryptocurrency in the process. In this project I gained experience writing Linux scripts that automate/monitor the mining rigs as well as controlling their low level hardware parameters. For GPU's this meant increasing their clock speeds and reducing voltage levels in order to get maximum performance while keeping electrical power draw to a minimum, which also helped to keep the machines from running too hot. </p>

    <p>Peaking at 750 MH/s (million hash operations per second) this mining rig generated approximately 0.4 Ethereum per week or 1.6 Ethereum per month</p>
